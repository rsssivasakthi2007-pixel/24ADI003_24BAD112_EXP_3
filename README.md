Scenario 1 – Multilinear Regression:

Dataset (Kaggle – Public) https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams

This project uses Multilinear Regression to predict student academic performance using the Students Performance in Exams dataset from Kaggle. The final exam score is calculated as the average of math, reading, and writing scores, and multiple factors such as study hours, attendance, parental education, test preparation, and sleep hours are used as input features. The data is preprocessed, scaled, and split into training and testing sets. Model performance is evaluated using MSE, RMSE, and R² score, and Ridge and Lasso regression are applied to improve accuracy.

Scenario 2 – Polynomial Regression:

Dataset (Kaggle – Public) https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/autompg-dataset

This project applies Polynomial Regression to predict vehicle fuel efficiency using the Auto MPG dataset from Kaggle. Engine horsepower is used as the input feature, and polynomial models of different degrees are trained to capture the non-linear relationship with MPG. The models are evaluated using MSE, RMSE, and R² score, and Ridge regression is used to reduce overfitting.
